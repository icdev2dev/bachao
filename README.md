Bachao is intended to solve for the primary use case of when you lose your internet identity's primary authentication mechanisms (yubi key, phone, computer etc) either through accident or theft. Essentially you inform your a set of your trusted friends and family about your internet identity in anticipation of this loss. When such a loss occurs, a subset of your trusted friends/family can vouch for your identity and your internet identity can be restored.
